# cub3D

## 🎮 Overview
**cub3D** is a 3D game project developed as part of the 42 curriculum, inspired by the classic **Wolfenstein 3D**. The project focuses on understanding and implementing **raycasting** algorithms to create a simple first-person shooter (FPS) engine. It simulates a 3D environment using 2D rendering techniques, allowing the player to navigate and interact within a maze-like world.

## ✨ Features
- **3D rendering using raycasting**
- **Player movement** with first-person controls
- **Grid-based map** with customizable layout
- **Texture mapping** for walls and objects
- **Collision detection** for walls and objects
- **Smooth frame rendering** for real-time gameplay

## 🔥 Bonus Features
In addition to the core functionalities, the project includes several **bonus features**:
- **Sprite rendering**: Support for rendering 2D sprites within the 3D environment (e.g. book items).
- **Minimap**: A functional minimap for real-time player navigation.

## 🛠️ Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/shapkina-l/cub3d.git
  ```
Compile the project:
  ```bash
  make
  ```
Run the game:
  ```bash
  ./cub3D maps/library.cub
  ```
## 🎯 Objectives
Mastering raycasting algorithms for real-time 3D rendering.
Implementing efficient game loop and input handling.
Enhancing gameplay through advanced features like mouse control and dynamic lighting.
